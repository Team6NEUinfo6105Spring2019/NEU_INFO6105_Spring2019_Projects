The main purpose of the role is to provide support to the BNY Mellon editorial team. 
 
Key Responsibilities 

The editorial writer will curate our weekly flagship mailer, which is one of the most important points of contact between the editorial/writing team and the wider business. 

As part of your role you may be asked to:

Upload content and design the email each week. 
Proof-read and edit copy then shepherd it through the sign-off and compliance process.
Write ad hoc news and feature articles.
Interview senior people, including fund managers. From this, you will need to be able to create content on a wide spectrum of topics – whether through video, infographics, blog posts, news or features. 

Our remit is a broad one. Recent coverage includes everything from technical trends (smart beta) to market moves (the retreat of emerging market debt) – from innovation (the rise of electric vehicles) to consumer behaviour (the changing spending habits of millennials and generation Z). 

One of the perks of the job is that there’s a ton of learning to be had. If you’re keen to learn, can assimilate information quickly and are curious about the changing world, we think you’ll fit in.
